<h1>Spirtual Gifts Survey</h1>

<h2>Directions</h2>
This is not a test, so there are no wrong answers. The <b>Spiritual Gifts Survey</b> consists of 80
statements. Some items reflect concrete actions; other items are descriptive traits; and still
others are statements of belief.
<ul>
    <li>Select the one response you feel best characterizes yourself and place that number in the blank provided. Record your answer in the blank beside each item. </li>
    <li>Do not spend too much time on any one item. Remember, it is not a test. Usually your immediate response is best. </li>
    <li>Please give an answer for each item.  Do not skip any items</li>
    <li>Do not ask others how they are answering or how they think you should answer</li>
    <li>Work at your own pace</li>
</ul>

Your response choices are:
<ol>
    <li>Not at all characteristic of me</li>
    <li>Occasionally characteristic of me</li>
    <li>Frequently characteristic of me</li>
    <li>Most of the time this would describe me</li>
    <li>Highly characteristic of me</li>
</ol>
